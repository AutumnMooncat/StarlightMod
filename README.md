# The Starlight Sisters

This mod currently adds a new playable character, The Sisters.

Alongside them is a huge draft of 165 cards, 11 Relics, and 5 Potions. While I do not yet know of any incompatibilities, please let me know if you find any.

Character, relic, and other assets are from Disgaea and are property of Nippon Ichi Software.

This mod is a work in progress, but it is still a fully playable (if not balanced) experience at the moment.

Features

_**Magicks:**_
Magick cards are a new classification of card that many other mechanics interact with. Magick is not a new type, but something that the card types you are familiar with can be, for instance, a Magick Attack vs a regular Attack.

_**Spellbooks:**_
At the character select screen, the sisters each get to choose a spellbook. These spellbooks dictate your starting deck and the cards you will see in a draft. This mod contains 45 cards which will appear in every run, and 8 spellbooks each containing 15 Magick cards. The 2 chosen books will then be combined with the base 45 cards for the run, resulting in 75 possible cards to see. Each spellbook specializes in a certain archetype, so you can mix and match books to create different strategies to suit your play style. 

_**Projection:**_
Projection offers the sisters a new way to play cards, offering a tradeoff between targeted immediate effects, and randomly targeted delayed effects that cost no Energy. Projected cards render above the sisters in the order in which they will be played, and at the start of their next turn, all projected cards are sequentially played at no cost. This comes with the downside of being unable to select targets, much like cards played by Mayhem, but allows you to play cards you otherwise wouldn't have the Energy for.

_**Providence:**_
Acting as a way to get the most out of your Magick cards, Providence is similar to Mantra, in that it activates an effect upon reading 10 stacks called Ascension. While Ascension is active, ALL values besides cost on your Magick cards are doubled. This allows for strategic use to Ascension for things like burst damage from your Magick Attacks, but also less obvious effects such as doubled energy gain or card draw, or even doubling the effectiveness of your Magick Powers.  

_**Spell Power:**_
Acting in a way similar for Vigor, Spell Power is a resources you retain until used that increases both the damage and Block of the next Magick card you play. This offers the potential tradeoff of using it for dealing more damage vs using it to take less damage. 

_**Foretell:**_ 
Acting as an additional way to control your card flow, Foretelling allows you to choose a card and set it on top of your draw pile. Aside from being able to play a given card more than once per deck shuffle, this mechanic provides synergy with effects that play or Project the top card of your draw pile, and there are also cards which have effects when they are Foretold.
